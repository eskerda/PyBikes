## 1 Intro
pybikes provides a python set of tools to scrape bike sharing data from different
websites and APIs, thus providing a coherent and generalized set of classes
and methods to access this sort of information.

The library is distributed and intended mainly for statistics and data-sharing projects. More importantly, it powers the [CityBikes][1] project, and
is composed of a set of classes and a pack of data files that provide instances
for all different systems.

## 2 Installation
------------

Install directly from GitHub:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/eskerda/pybikes.git
```

Or after downloading/cloning the source:
```bash
python setup.py install
```

The following dependencies are required (example using Ubuntu package manager):
```
sudo apt-get install python
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
sudo apt-get install libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libgeos-dev
```

## 3 Usage
-----
```python
>>> import pybikes

# Capital BikeShare instantiation data is in bixi.json file
>>> capital_bikeshare = pybikes.get('capital-bikeshare')

# The instance contains all possible metadata regarding this system
>>> print(capital_bikeshare.meta)
{
    'name': 'Capital BikeShare',
    'city': 'Washington, DC - Arlington, VA',
    'longitude': -77.0363658,
    'system': 'Bixi',
    'company': ['PBSC'],
    'country': 'USA',
    'latitude': 38.8951118
}
# The update method retrieves the list of stations
>>> print(len(capital_bikeshare.stations))
0
>>> capital_bikeshare.update()
>>> print(len(capital_bikeshare.stations))
191
>>> print(capital_bikeshare.stations[0])
--- 31000 - 20th & Bell St ---
bikes: 7
free: 4
latlng: 38.8561,-77.0512
extra: {
    'installed': True,
    'uid': 1,
    'locked': False,
    'removalDate': '',
    'installDate': '1316059200000',
    'terminalName': '31000',
    'temporary': False,
    'name': '20th & Bell St',
    'latestUpdateTime': '1353454305589'
}
```

Some systems might require an API key to work (for instance, Cyclocity). In
these cases, the instance factory can take an extra API key parameter.

```python
>>> key = "This is not an API key"
>>> dublinbikes = pybikes.get('dublinbikes', key)
```

Note that pybikes works as an instance factory and, choicely, instances can be
generated by passing the right arguments to the desired class

```python
>>> from pybikes.cyclocity import BixiSystem
>>> capital_bikeshare = BixiSystem(
        tag = 'foo_tag',
        root_url = 'http://capitalbikeshare.com/data/stations/',
        meta = {'foo':'bar'}
    )
```

The way information is retrieved can be tweaked using the PyBikesScraper class
included on the utils module thus allowing session reusing and niceties such as
using a proxy. This class uses [Requests][2] module internally.

```python
>>> scraper = pybikes.utils.PyBikesScraper()
>>> scraper.enableProxy()
>>> scraper.setProxies({
        "http" : "127.0.0.1:8118",
        "https": "127.0.0.1:8118"
    })
>>> scraper.setUserAgent("Walrusâ„¢ v3.0")
>>> scraper.headers['Foo'] = 'bar'
>>> capital_bikeshare.update(scraper)
```

## 4 Tests
-----
Tests are separated between unit tests and integration tests with the different
sources supported.

To run unit tests simply

```bash
make test
```

To run integration tests

```bash
make test-update
```

Note that some systems require authorization keys, tests expect these to be
set as environment variables like:

```bash
PYBIKES_CYCLOCITY='some-api-key'
PYBIKES_DEUTSCHEBAHN_CLIENT_ID='some-client-id'
PYBIKES_DEUTSCHEBAHN_CLIENT_SECRET='some-client-secret'

# or if using an .env file
# source .env

make test-update
```

This project uses pytest for tests. Test a particular network by passing a
filter expresson

```bash
pytest -k bicing
pytest -k gbfs
```

To speed up tests execution, install [pytest-xdist][3] to specify the number of
CPUs to use

```bash
pytest -k gbfs -n auto
```

To use Makefile steps and pass along pytest arguments, append to the `T_FLAGS`
variable

```bash
make test-update T_FLAGS+='-n 10 -k gbfs'
```

Integration tests can generate a json report file with all extracted data stored
as geojson. Using this json report file, further useful reports can be generated
like a summary of the overall health of the library or a map visualization of
all the information.

For more information on reports see [utils/README.md][4]
